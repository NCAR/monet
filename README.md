Current effort is being added to add in the ASOS network, the Climate Reference Network, sonde data and more. It will compute statistics, make time series, spatial and scatter plots, and more!

### Note for data I/O

Note that as of version 2.1.5 MONET has been split into two repositories,
[MONET](https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monet) and
[MONETIO](https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monetio).
This was done to simplify the build process for each repository and allow each to develop independently.
