### Note for data I/O

Note that as of version 2.1.5 MONET has been split into two repositories,
[MONET](https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monet) and
[MONETIO](https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monetio).
This was done to simplify the build process for each repository and allow each to develop independently.
